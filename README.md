Marlin
======

Marlin is a control system designed to create intuitive interfacing with quadcopters using simple gyro-based mobile controls and image processing.


The X1 Folder supports image tracking via a computer webcam and a Syma X1 quadcopter with a modified reciever (see schematics)

The Beagleboard Folder contains code that supports image tracking and mobile control with a beagleboard sending pwm signals to the reciever I/O on a control board. This setup has been tested on Adupilot Mega 2.6, KK2.0 and Multiwii 2.2, but should theoretically work with any standard autopilot board and software/

Image Processing and autopilot interfacing by Gary Chien and Rahul Tiwari. Mobile app by Matt Slane and Rahul Tiwari. Quadcopter design by Andrew Erickson, Dan Dao, and Rahul Tiwari.
